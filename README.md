# Welcome to Brew Time!

Brew Time is a front end framework that supports the iSpindel wireless hydometer. 

## Setup


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For full set up documentation visit [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

To view this project first:

Fork and Clone!

Then you will only need to run two commands to get a local server started:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The backend is hosted on Heroku and link to the github is [here](https://github.com/Nepsaco/ispindel-backend/), but note this only works with my personal iSpindel and will need to be reconfigured to a different URL if you would like to incorporate this for yourself. There is more information on the backend page.
